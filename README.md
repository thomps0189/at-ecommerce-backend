  # Description 
  This is a program where I can track my employees, departments, and roles. When I choose "View All Departments/Roles/Employees" I am then taken to a table with all the information. When I want to add a Department/Role/Employee I am then able to input that information with questions I am prompted and that information is put into the existing tables. Last, when I want to update an Employee I am given a list of my current employees, I am then able to select their name, and update their role id.
